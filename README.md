# Library Management System 

Welcome to the Library Management System, an open-source software solution designed to bring efficiency and user-friendliness to library resource management. Developed using Python, this system combines the power of Tkinter for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management, offering a comprehensive toolkit for library administrators and users.

# Key Features:

# Member Registration: Easily onboard library members with unique identifiers, including member type, PRN (Permanent Registration Number), ID, and personal information.

# Effortless Book Selection: Simplify the book selection process with a predefined list of titles. The system auto-populates book details like ID, title, author, and price, reducing data entry errors.

# Member Data Management: Empower administrators to view and modify member details, ensuring that records remain accurate and up to date.

# Show Data Functionality: A standout feature that provides a clear, organized view of member information, enhancing verification and cross-referencing.

# Administrator Privileges: Grant administrators the ability to add, update, and delete member data, ensuring a reliable and up-to-date database.

# Late Fee Calculation and Due Date Management: Take library management a step further with automated late fee calculations and overdue item tracking, promoting timely returns and accountability.

# Technical Excellence:
Behind the scenes, the project utilizes the mysql.connector library to establish a secure and efficient connection to the MySQL database, demonstrating prowess in database management and connectivity. The Tkinter-based GUI boasts an intuitive design with elements like labels, buttons, and entry fields, providing an accessible and user-friendly experience.

Versatile Application:
This project not only serves as a testament to software development skills but also addresses the practical needs of libraries and educational institutions. It's an excellent showcase for data analysts interested in data management and user interface design.
